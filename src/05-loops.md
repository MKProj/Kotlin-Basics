# Loops

## for Loops 

A `for` loop is used when we know how many times we want a section of code repeated. 

Let's examine the following code: 

```kotlin 
var list = listOf["Hello", "Example", "Test"]

for (i in 0..list){
    println(list[i])
}
/* Prints: 
Hello
Example
Test 
*/
```

- `for` is a keyword used to declare a for loop.
- We define `i` as the loop variable. This variable holds the current iteration value and can be used within the loop body.
- The `in` keyword is between the variable definition and the iterator.
- The range `0..list` is the for loop iterator.

An `iterator` is an object that allows us to step through and access every individual element in a collection of values. 

**Note:** It is important to note that the loop variable only exists within the loopâ€™s code block. 
Trying to access the loop variable outside the `for` loop will result in an error.

### Controlling Iteration 
Sometimes we want to count backwards, or count by 5s, or maybe both! Using certain functions alongside or instead of the normal range operator `(..)` can enhance the iterative abilities of our `for` loops. The functions `downTo`, `until` and `step` give us more control of a range and therefore more control of our loops.

- The `downTo` function simply creates a reverse order group of values, where the starting boundary is greater than the ending boundary. To accomplish this, replace the range operator `(..)` with `downTo`:
```kotlin
for (i in 4 downTo 1) {
  println("i = $i")
}
/*
Output: 
i = 4
i = 3
i = 2
i = 1
*/
```
We can see in the output that the first number in i is 4 and the last is 1  

- The `until` function creates an ascending range, just like the `(..)` operator, but excludes the upper boundary:
```kotlin
for (i in 1 until 4) {
  println("i = $i")
}
/*
Output: 
i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
*/
```
The upper boundary, 4, is not included in the output 


- Up until now, each of these functions, including the range operator (..), have counted up or down by one. 
The `step` function specifies the amount these functions count by:
```kotlin
for (i in 1..8 step 2) {
  println("i = $i")
}
/*
Output: 
i = 1
i = 3
i = 5
i = 7
*/
```
The loop variable `i` now increases by 2 for every iteration. The last number output is `7`, 
since 2 steps up from that is `9` which is outside the defined range, `1..8`
